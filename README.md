### Hello, my name is Joseph (he/him). I'm currently enrolled in Tech Elevator's Java course. I'm a novice who is looking forward to a career in development. I have two four year olds: a Bernedoodle named Barney, and a human boy named Patrick. I'm looking for help with pretty much everything at the moment. You can reach me at jtcozzens@gmail.com if you want to ask me questions about coding which I won't know, or we can just chat about post bop jazz. The journey is yours
